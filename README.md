# KAN-EEG

To train the model, run TUH.py

For inferences, run EPILEPSIAE.py or RPA.py. 

Both can be modified depending on the dataset you want to use, as well number of channels, or if the signal is in time-domain or time-frequency domain. We evaluated the EEG signal as time-frequency domain through Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
